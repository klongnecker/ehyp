Please create pull requests to get content in here.. It may take me a while to do so.. 

How this works:

## /parts

Conains parts, such as inductions, wakeners, or suggestions

## /scripts

For scripts which can't be broken up into parts.

## /instructions

Starter guides and what not


# Note

I am not particular about how this works in the long run.. if you come up with a pull request that restructures the whole thing.. I am all for it.. If you have a pull request which removes a lot of content.. I will probably be against that.
